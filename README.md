# Ansible Security Demo
This demo will showcase security automation with Ansible Tower.  My goal with this demo is to showcase a few activities of daily living in the life of a security analyst.  This will include things like firewall rule provisioning, vpn profile creation, and enriching log sources for an investigation.

## Problems Addressed
Daily activities that consume time and could be automated are often overlooked big shiny things when it comes to automation adoption.  

## Requirements
You'll need to spin up the [Ansible Security Workshop](https://github.com/ansible/workshops)
1) Create a new project called "Security Demo" and use this repository [ansible-security-demo](https://github.com/corumj/ansible-security-demo)


## Instructions
1) Setup and run the demo_setup.yml playbook as a job template in your Tower environment.
